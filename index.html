<h1>C.J. Driggers</h1>
<h2>Freshman at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
<p>I am currently a freshman at Bob Jones University, and I am studying Computer Science as my major. 
The society in which I am now a member is the Panters. I used to work as a sales associate at the Hamrick's store in Easley. 
Now I am between jobs, hoping to land a parttime job soon.</p>
<p>I love to play basketball, and I also enjoy eating, sleeping, and (of course) hanging out with friends. 
I graduated from Tabernacle Christian School. This year I am attending Zion Hill Baptist Church in Greenville, and I love it so much. </p>
<p>One day I hope to join the National Guard and get a job in military intelligence. 
I think learning Computer Science might give help me to better to do that job and know how to do more.</p>
